#### Dev log

* 10/2/2022 - Added art for CodeSpells and Dear Human
* 10/1/2022 - Added all art info comments for DTC, Teaching, ThoughtSTEM, Minecraft, Gambit Queen, Coding tiles.   About 14 to go?
* 9/30/2022 - Added all Dolly's Dragon and Music homepage contest tiles
* 9/29/2022 - Began working on landing pages: ArtInfoComments  
* 9/28/2022 - Better link colors.  Fixed image sizes in documents.  Revised Don't Teach Coding page.
* 9/23/2022 - Explored typesetting music.  Because I like playing violin, but I haven't been putting it on my website because this was a blocker.
* 9/27/2022 - Began designing the FullDocument, also a contact me side card
* 9/19/2022 - RELEASED new version
* 9/18/2022 - LOTS more tiles
* 9/17/2022 - Purchased Nightcafe -- might as well!  Added Minecraft tile to homepage.
* 9/16/2022 - Decided to remove about me tile, making it a link instead. Added more links above -- more work for homepage tiles...
* 9/15/2022 - Did a nice fade and mouse over effect for homepage.  Added Dolly's Dragon tile 
* 9/14/2022 - Made the text visible on top of the homepage image tiles.  TODO: Bring back about me tile!  Added sc2 tile to homepage.  Added images on the content landing pages.
* 9/13/2022 - Made website tiles have pictures only.  Still not sure if this is the best (maybe add back the titles?).  Might need some A/B tests.  Oops lost the about me...  TODO: Add in fade
* 9/12/2022 - Switched to darkmode.  Learned that it takes a long time to add a new top-level tile to the homepage, should shorten this process (but should decide first how much content deserves a full tile...).  TODO: Maybe make a script.  Started a wiki on the [random](/#/random) page.  Considered that maybe a wiki would make a better homepage, or at least that the homepage could have more text on it...
