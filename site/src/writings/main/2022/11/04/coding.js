export const text =

Made a version of \`wrap\` that takes a list of wrappings.  Next step is to automatically generate some of these wrappings from the original text. 

\`\`\`js
wraps([
        { from: "As the sun rose,", to: "not a day later.", element: (props) => <div style={{ color: "orange" }}>{props.children}</div> } ,
        { from: "As the sun rose", to: "quest soon.", element: (props) => <div style={{ color: "red" }}>{props.children}</div> },
        { from: "As the sun rose,", to: "doom for all.", element: (props) => <div style={{ color: "yellow" }}>{props.children}</div> },
        { from: "As the sun rose,", to: "could not foresee.", element: (props) => <div style={{ color: "lime" }}>{props.children}</div> },
        { from: "A few hours", to: "wouldn't do to wait.", element: (props) => <div style={{ color: "cyan" }}>{props.children}</div> },
        { from: "The King's Committee", to: "abandon the invasion.", element: (props) => <p style={{ color: "magenta" }} {...props} /> } ]
        ,
        fixWordPunctuation(part1, data))
\`\`\`

The above renders out like so:
