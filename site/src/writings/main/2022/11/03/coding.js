Made some utility functions to help me designate the parts of a transcription that should be wrapped in some component, as well as some functions for fixing up Amazon's bogus punctuation (based on the original text).

\`\`\`js
<FetchThen
  from="/short-videos/shortstories/never-ends/e1.json"
  then={(data) =>  
    wrap({ from: "As the sun rose", 
           to: "quest soon.", 
           element: (props) => <div style={{ color: "red" }}>{props.children}</div> }, 
         fixWordPunctuation(part1, data)) }} />
\`\`\`

If you want to call \`wrap\` twice (see output below), it gets a bit messy, though.  So I'll try to fix that tomorrow.  

All in all, I'm close to being able to embed ai-generated art as illustrations...  To be continued.
